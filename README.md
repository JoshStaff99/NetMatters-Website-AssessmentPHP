Ensure you have a local web server environment with PHP and a database system such as MySQL or MariaDB.

You can use tools like: XAMPP, MAMP, Laragon

# Example .env file
Server settings
PORT=5000
HOST=localhost

Database
DB_HOST=localhost

DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASS=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name

API keys
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Step 5 – Launch the Application
If you're using PHP's built-in server for development, you can run: php -S localhost:5000 -t public 
Replace public with your actual document root if different.
Alternatively, place the project in your web server's root directory (e.g., htdocs) and access it via your browser: http://localhost/your-project-folder/
